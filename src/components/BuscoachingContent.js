                                Businesses in the current digital world are complex. They need to maintain their
                                lead over the competitors, be profitable, and make a difference (or stay relevant)
                                to their customers while doing this effectively and more efficiently than ever.
                                Some of this might work smoothly while the business is still growing. But as
                                Scale comes into the picture, it leaves little room for leaders to pause and reflect.
                                One can quickly lose sight and perspective of what is essential when constantly
                                juggling many responsibilities. Business coaching is critical to steer them back
                                on track and be relevant; it is pretty crucial.

                                At a foundational level, Business coaching involves a coach working with
                                business leaders to assist them in achieving their business objectives. The
                                common focus areas for business coaches include Leadership, strategy, sales,
                                marketing, personal development, and so on.

                                Business coaching typically entails regular one-on-one or small group sessions in
                                which the coach assists the business leaders in identifying goals, developing a
                                strategy to achieve those goals, and developing the skills and tactics necessary
                                to put the plan into action. To assist the leaders of a business in staying on track
                                and making progress, the coach may also provide feedback, direction, and
                                accountability.

                                Business coaches help their clients develop strategies and action plans for
                                success by identifying areas of their business that can be improved. As every
                                business is different and has different requirements, business coaching is meant
                                to be a highly customised and adaptable process. Some business coaches work
                                with business leaders to develop a comprehensive strategy for the company's
                                growth and development, while others help business owners develop a specific
                                skill or competency.
